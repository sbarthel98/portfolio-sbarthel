# Comparative Analysis of Ethical Frameworks

**Date**: January 10, 2026  
**Student**: Stijn Barthel  
**Assignment**: Ethical Models for Data Science Decision-Making

---

## Introduction

This analysis compares two procedural ethical frameworks designed to guide decision-making in data science contexts. Both frameworks provide structured approaches to ethical deliberation, emphasizing rational analysis over intuitive judgment.

---

## Selected Models

### The Potter Box

A cyclical model developed by Ralph B. Potter Jr., utilizing four interdependent quadrants:

1. **Definition (Facts)**: Empirical situation analysis
2. **Values**: Identification of competing values at stake
3. **Principles**: Application of ethical theories (Kantian, Utilitarian, etc.)
4. **Loyalties**: Explicit choice of allegiance (stakeholders, public, employer)

**Key Characteristic**: Recursive structure allowing iterative refinement between stages.

### The Markkula Center Framework

A linear, comprehensive model from Santa Clara University evaluating decisions through five specific "lenses":

1. **Utilitarian Lens**: Consequences and outcomes
2. **Rights Lens**: Individual rights and dignity
3. **Justice Lens**: Fair distribution and equal treatment
4. **Common Good Lens**: Community welfare and social conditions
5. **Virtue Lens**: Character and moral excellence

**Key Characteristic**: Diagnostic checklist ensuring comprehensive evaluation across dimensions.

## Comparative Analysis

### Similarities

Both frameworks are:

- **Rational and Procedural**: Require systematic analysis rather than intuitive judgment
- **Anti-Intuitionist**: Deliberately slow down decision-making to prevent reactive choices
- **Theory-Inclusive**: Incorporate standard philosophical theories (Kantian duty, Utilitarian consequences) as analytical tools
- **Fact-Based**: Require gathering empirical data before ethical evaluation

### Differences

| Aspect | Potter Box | Markkula Framework |
|--------|------------|-------------------|
| **Structure** | Recursive (iterative between quadrants) | Linear (sequential checklist) |
| **Primary Focus** | Loyalties (stakeholder allegiance) | Holistic evaluation (multiple lenses) |
| **Flexibility** | High (user chooses ethical principle) | Moderate (principles pre-defined) |
| **Complexity** | Requires philosophical knowledge | Provides ready-made analytical categories |
| **Risk** | May overlook inconvenient perspectives | May become mechanical checklist |

---

## Personal Preference

**Preference**: Markkula Center Framework

**Rationale**: The Markkula Framework provides superior diagnostic precision. While the Potter Box excels at clarifying personal allegiance and stakeholder conflicts, it depends on the practitioner's knowledge of ethical theories and willingness to apply them rigorously. The Markkula Framework eliminates this dependency by providing the analytical lenses explicitly, reducing the risk of conveniently ignoring uncomfortable perspectives.

The framework's structured approach ensures that critical dimensions like justice and rights receive explicit consideration, rather than being subsumed under broader value categories.

## Suitability for Data Ethics

The **Markkula Framework is superior for data ethics** for several reasons:

### 1. Invisible Harm Detection

Data issues often involve invisible or delayed harm (privacy violations, algorithmic bias, system failures). The multi-lens approach ensures these non-obvious impacts are systematically examined.

### 2. Rights Lens Application

Directly addresses privacy and consent issues:
- GDPR compliance evaluation
- Data subject rights assessment
- Informed consent verification
- Privacy impact analysis

### 3. Justice Lens for Algorithmic Fairness

Specifically targets algorithmic bias and discrimination:
- Disparate impact analysis
- Fairness metric selection
- Protected group treatment comparison
- Structural disadvantage identification

### 4. Utilitarian Lens for Scale

Data systems operate at scale, making consequentialist analysis critical:
- Aggregate harm assessment
- Population-level impact evaluation
- Trade-off quantification

### 5. Common Good Lens for Collective Impact

Data practices affect entire communities:
- Digital divide considerations
- Social trust implications
- Public infrastructure effects

---

## Application to Data Science Contexts

The Markkula Framework maps well to common data ethics challenges:

| Challenge | Primary Lens | Supporting Lenses |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Algorithmic Bias | Justice | Rights, Common Good |
| Privacy Violations | Rights | Utilitarian, Virtue |
| Explainability | Rights | Justice, Common Good |
| Dual Use Technology | Utilitarian | Virtue, Common Good |
| Data Collection Practices | Rights | Justice, Utilitarian |

---

## Limitations and Considerations

Both frameworks have limitations:

### Potter Box Limitations
- Requires philosophical training
- Loyalties can be manipulated
- May become circular reasoning

### Markkula Framework Limitations
- Can become mechanical checklist
- Lenses may conflict without resolution mechanism
- May not capture context-specific nuances

### Recommendation

Use Markkula Framework for **initial assessment** and **documentation** (ensures comprehensive coverage). Apply Potter Box for **complex stakeholder conflicts** where loyalty trade-offs are central.

## Conclusion

For data science practitioners, the Markkula Center Framework provides a more accessible and comprehensive starting point for ethical analysis. Its explicit lens-based structure ensures that critical dimensions like algorithmic fairness (Justice Lens) and privacy rights (Rights Lens) receive dedicated attention, making it particularly well-suited for addressing the systemic and often invisible harms characteristic of data-driven systems.

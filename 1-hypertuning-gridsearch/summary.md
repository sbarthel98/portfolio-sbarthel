# Summary: Hyperparameter Tuning with Grid Search

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - January 5, 2026

This project successfully executed 61 systematic hyperparameter tuning experiments on a neural network trained on the Fashion MNIST dataset. All experiments, analysis, visualizations, and comprehensive reports are complete.

**Key Results Achieved:**
- **Best Performance**: 85.5% accuracy (epochs_10)
- **Best Combined Config**: 84.2% accuracy (combined_config_2)  
- **Most Impactful**: Optimizer choice (65.9% performance swing)
- **Critical Insight**: Vanilla SGD failed completely (17% accuracy)
- **Surprise Finding**: Shallow networks (1 layer) beat deeper ones

## 🎯 Objectives

1. ✅ Experiment with various hyperparameters (epochs, units, batch size, depth, learning rate, optimizer)
2. ✅ Analyze and visualize the relationships between hyperparameters
3. ✅ Reflect on findings using the scientific method (hypothesis → experiment → analysis → conclusion)
4. ✅ Create data-driven reports documenting insights and recommendations
